### Hey! üëã

My name is Stanley, and I'm a Senior Front-end Software Engineer. I have spent the last few years building software applications to solve exciting and challenging problems.

My experiences ranges from building applications for E-commerce, Insurance, Banking, Clinical trials and Engineering industries.

I have also have full-stack experience working with Java, Nodejs, Python and Django. And recently, with the advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models, I have not only developed strong interest, but I have also explored areas of AI and LLMs such as: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications, LLM fine-turning and AI agents.
